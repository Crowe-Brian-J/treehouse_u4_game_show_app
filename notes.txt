Notes for adding more me to it:

X Add more phrases (Game.js --- Line 31)

Notes to check logic:

- Check this.gameOver(false) (Game.js --- Line 90)
X See if I need to add a space on textContent of spaces (Phrase.js --- Line 32)
- Add hint on screen for disabled button keyboard press (app.js --- Line 42)
- Show hint if keystroke other than letter
- Ensure words aren't broken up - IMPORTANT
-- Maybe add logic to choose which line to display on?
- Add Logic to display correct phrase after win
