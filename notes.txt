Notes for adding more me to it:

- Add more phrases (Game.js --- Line 31)
- Remove ability to highlight letters in game - possibly just when hidden - current game reveals m's easily
- See about adding opensource music - seems dull without
- Look at adding retro styling - GameBoy?
- Maybe Old West Theme because Hangman
- Add a small delay before game over message
- Fade in or Fade out animations
- Visual cue for last remaining life

Notes to check logic:

- Check this.gameOver(false) (Game.js --- Line 90)
- See if I need to add a space on textContent of spaces (Phrase.js --- Line 32)
